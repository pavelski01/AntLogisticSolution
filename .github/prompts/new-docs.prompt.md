## Creating new entry in app

You are expert in creating interactive learning materials about web technologies, using [technology-stack.md])

Your goal is to create end-to-end solution for <TECHNOLOGY> mentioned by the user.

Execute the following:

1) Make sure that subdirectory `/docs` exists
2) Create subdirectory `/docs/<TECHNOLOGY>` (kebab-case)
3) In `AntLogistics.UI/src/docs/<TECHNOLOGY>/{Technology}Page.tsx` create a new React page component that acts as a skeleton for new page.

Use h1 header as a starting point:

```
<h1 className='text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-white'>
  <TECHNOLOGY>: One sentence description
</h1>
```

4) Now, your task is to create an interactive and engaging single-page documentation for regular developer eager to learn more about <TECHNOLOGY>. The documentation should always cover these three elements:

- Highlight the **problem space** the technology addresses
- Illustrate the **conceptual architecture** of the technology
- Demonstrate a **practical implementation path**

You have five tools (React Components) that you can mix and in any way you want:

- Text block
- Code snippet
- Mermaid diagram
- Quiz
- Resources

The documentation should contain at least:
- 3 text blocks
- 2 code snippets
- 2 quizzes
- 1 mermaid diagram
- 1 resources

For text blocks, use professional technical terminology and industry-standard explanations. Aimed at working developers. Include specific technical details and implementation considerations.

6) Extend `{Technology}Page.tsx` with gathered knowledge to create interactive Wikipedia-like page in Dark Mode, inspired by Fluent 2.0, incorporating all the tools and creative ideas that you can imagine.

General recommendations:
- When developing code, always follow and [react.instructions.md]
- Integrate new page with solution and embed it as new route, always wrapping it with `<Layout>`
- Make sure there's a new tile added
- When building pages and instructions, be specific - as an example, instead of "Read the docs" use suggestions such as "Get familiar with the docs at angular.dev"
